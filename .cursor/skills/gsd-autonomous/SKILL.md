<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-autonomous` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Execute all remaining milestone phases autonomously. For each phase: discuss → plan → execute. Pauses only for user decisions (grey area acceptance, blockers, validation requests).

Uses ROADMAP.md phase discovery and Skill() flat invocations for each phase command. After all phases complete: milestone audit → complete → cleanup.

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.planning/STATE.md` — updated after each phase
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — progress updated after each phase
- Phase artifacts — CONTEXT.md, PLANs, SUMMARYs per phase

**After:** Milestone is complete and cleaned up.

</execution_context>

<context>
Optional flags:
- `--from N` — start from phase N instead of the first incomplete phase.
- `--to N` — stop after phase N completes (halt instead of advancing to next phase).
- `--only N` — execute only phase N (single-phase mode).
- `--interactive` — run discuss inline with questions (not auto-answered), then dispatch plan→execute as background agents. Keeps the main context lean while preserving user input on decisions.

Project context, phase list, and state are resolved inside the workflow using init commands (`gsd-sdk query init.milestone-op`, `gsd-sdk query roadmap.analyze`). No upfront context loading needed.
</context>

<process>
Execute the autonomous workflow from @D:/Fontes/peladas/.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/autonomous.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (phase discovery, per-phase execution, blocker handling, progress display).
