<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-analyze-dependencies` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Analyze the phase dependency graph for the current milestone. For each phase pair, determine if there is a dependency relationship based on:
- File overlap (phases that modify the same files must be ordered)
- Semantic dependencies (a phase that uses an API built by another phase)
- Data flow (a phase that consumes output from another phase)

Then suggest `Depends on` updates to ROADMAP.md.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@D:/Fontes/peladas/.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/analyze-dependencies.md
</execution_context>

<context>
No arguments required. Requires an active milestone with ROADMAP.md.

Run this command BEFORE `/gsd-manager` to fill in missing `Depends on` fields and prevent merge conflicts from unordered parallel execution.
</context>

<process>
Execute the analyze-dependencies workflow from @D:/Fontes/peladas/.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/analyze-dependencies.md end-to-end.
Present dependency suggestions clearly and apply confirmed updates to ROADMAP.md.
</process>
