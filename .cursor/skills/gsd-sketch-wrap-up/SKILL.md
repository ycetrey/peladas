<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-sketch-wrap-up` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Curate sketch design findings and package them into a persistent project skill that Claude
auto-loads when building the real UI. Also writes a summary to `.planning/sketches/` for
project history. Output skill goes to `./.cursor/skills/sketch-findings-[project]/` (project-local).
</objective>

<execution_context>
@D:/Fontes/peladas/.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/sketch-wrap-up.md
@D:/Fontes/peladas/.cursor/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `conversational prompting`.
</runtime_note>

<process>
Execute the sketch-wrap-up workflow from @D:/Fontes/peladas/.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/sketch-wrap-up.md end-to-end.
Preserve all curation gates (per-sketch review, grouping approval, .cursor/rules/ routing line).
