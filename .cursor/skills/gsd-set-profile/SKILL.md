<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-set-profile` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

Show the following output to the user verbatim, with no extra commentary:

!`if ! command -v gsd-sdk >/dev/null 2>&1; then printf '⚠ gsd-sdk not found in PATH — /gsd-set-profile requires it.\n\nInstall the GSD SDK:\n  npm install -g @gsd-build/sdk\n\nOr update GSD to get the latest packages:\n  /gsd-update\n'; exit 1; fi; gsd-sdk query config-set-model-profile {{GSD_ARGS}} --raw`
