<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-remove-phase` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Remove an unstarted future phase from the roadmap and renumber all subsequent phases to maintain a clean, linear sequence.

Purpose: Clean removal of work you've decided not to do, without polluting context with cancelled/deferred markers.
Output: Phase deleted, all subsequent phases renumbered, git commit as historical record.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@D:/Fontes/peladas/.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/remove-phase.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase: {{GSD_ARGS}}

Roadmap and state are resolved in-workflow via `init phase-op` and targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
Execute the remove-phase workflow from @D:/Fontes/peladas/.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/remove-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all validation gates (future phase check, work check), renumbering logic, and commit.
</process>
