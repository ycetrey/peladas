<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-ultraplan-phase` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")
</cursor_skill_adapter>

<objective>
Offload GSD's plan phase to Cursor's ultraplan cloud infrastructure.

Ultraplan drafts the plan in a remote cloud session while your terminal stays free.
Review and comment on the plan in your browser, then import it back via /gsd-import --from.

⚠ BETA: ultraplan is in research preview. Use /gsd-plan-phase for stable local planning.
Requirements: Cursor v2.1.91+, claude.ai account, GitHub repository.
